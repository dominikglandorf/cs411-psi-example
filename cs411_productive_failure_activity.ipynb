To execute any cell, place your cursor in the cell and either click the play button on the top left corner of the notebook, or, press Shift+Enter on your keyboard. It might take a couple of seconds to receive an output. \n\nHave fun!",

Quartiles divide a rank-ordered data set into four equal parts. IQR is equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles.\n\n3. **Spearman's correlation** measures the strength and direction of monotonic association between two variables. A monotonic relationship is a relationship that does one of the following: (1) as the value of one variable increases, so does the value of the other variable; or (2) as the value of one variable increases, the other variable value decreases. \n\n4. **Parallel coordinates** is a plotting technique for multivariate data (allows one to estimate some descriptive statistics visually). Here, data points are represented as connected line segments. Each vertical line represents one data attribute. One complete set of connected line segments across all the attributes represents one data point.",
